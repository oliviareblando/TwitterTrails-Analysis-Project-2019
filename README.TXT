We create a bipartite graph that displays
the interactions between different users and stories. If a user retweeted a
story, and edge between the story and user was created. Our RATgraph 
class holds one instance variable: an AdjListsGraph object 
(a graph implementation). Our RATgraph class also contains a method that 
reads a file that holds data about Russian twitter accounts and stories
they retweeted. That same method also populates the graph with vertices
and creates edges between them. The RATgraph object and its properties
are then examined in the Investigate class. This allowed us to answer 
several important questions using the tools that are inherent to the 
bipartite graph we created using our AdjListsGraph class, for example,
the ability to conduct a Depth-First Search.
